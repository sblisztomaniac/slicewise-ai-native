## ‚úÖ \[MVP] Smart Sample Scenario with Guided Onboarding

**üìå Problem:**

* 2 Founders (e.g., 60/40 split)
* 10% ESOP pool
* 1 SAFE (\$200K @ \$4M cap)
* 1 Seed round (\$1M @ \$6M pre)

Include a Claude Copilot explanation on load that says:

> ‚ÄúThis is a common setup for early-stage startups. Let‚Äôs see how ownership evolves.‚Äù

**üéØ Framework Alignment:**
\#3 ‚Äì Aha moment in seconds
\#5 ‚Äì Show working outcome
\#12 ‚Äì Prioritize UX
\#13 ‚Äì Test with real users

**‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria:**

* [ ] ‚ÄúLoad Sample Scenario‚Äù button exists
* [ ] Loads cap table with pre-filled data
* [ ] Claude explains setup in plain English
* [ ] Editable by user

## ‚úÖ \[MVP] Explain My Funding Round (AI Copilot)

**üìå Problem:**
Users don‚Äôt understand what happened after entering a funding round ‚Äî especially how dilution affects ownership.

* Reference valuation, pre/post, and SAFE conversions

**üéØ Framework Alignment:**
\#2 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt make users think

2. Enter amount
3. Enter pre/post valuation
4. (Optional) Add investors

# üßæ Epic: Funding Round UX Improvements

These issues aim to improve the user experience around adding and understanding funding rounds in SliceWise.

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Explain Suggested Round Inputs

**Problem:** Users don‚Äôt know what valuation or amount to input.

**Solution:** Add an info section or toggle below the round form.

**Explanation Should Include:**

* Typical seed round ranges (\$500k‚Äì\$2M)
* Valuation suggestions based on prior SAFE caps
* Example output like:

  > "At a \$6M pre and \$1M raised, you'd issue \~1.83M shares and dilute founders by 6%."

**Framework Alignment:**

* \#1 (Simplify)
* \#3 (Faster Aha Moment)
* \#5 (Outcome clarity)
* \#12 (UX focus)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Save + Display Round Details Clearly

**Problem:** Claude‚Äôs answer disappears, and round data isn‚Äôt persistent.

**Solution:**

* Update the `funding_rounds` array in context or Supabase.
* Keep previous rounds in memory or DB.
* Add a visual recap list below the form (e.g., Round name, valuation, ownership %).

**Framework Alignment:**

* \#4 (Convince in onboarding)
* \#5 (Show outcomes)
* \#7 (User feels smarter)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Improve AI Output Formatting

**Problem:** Explanation is crammed and not skimmable.

**Solution:**

* Break into bullet points with line breaks
* Use bolding for names and percentages
* Add emoji if in 12yo mode (üéØ üìä üîç)

**Framework Alignment:**

* \#3 (Faster Aha)
* \#8 (Remove UI friction)
* \#9 (Memorability)
